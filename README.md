# AWS Lambdas and layers for Machine Learning

The simplicity and cost-efficiency of Lambdas make it worthwhile to consider for models deployment and real-time inferencing. A Lambda function could be just a few lines of code that can handle millions of requests without the need of investing time and effort in building servers and high availability infrastructures.

By using our Machine learning layers and examples you may:

* Save time and avoid the pain. The process of building, optimizing, and maintaining a Lambda layer is hard and painful, especially for Machine Learning with Python. It could take between a few days and a couple of weeks for a well-experienced geek.

* Benefit from our experience. Our layers have been optimized over the years and extensively tested through thousands of deployments.

* Small size. When it comes to a Lambda layer, every bit counts. Our layers are very small what allows more space for your application.

* Keep up with the latest versions. We release new layers with the latest versions regularly.

# Ready-to-use AWS Lambda examples with layers

[Tutorial: "AWS Lambda with Numpy and SciPy"](https://github.com/mlpacks/aws-lambda-numpy)   
NumPy and SciPy are popular scientific python libraries extensively used for Machine learning.

[Tutorial: "AWS Lambda with Pandas"](https://github.com/mlpacks/aws-lambda-pandas)   
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use data analysis and manipulation tool, that together with NumPy and SciPy are extensively used for Machine learning.

[Tutorial: "AWS Lambda with Scikit-learn and Pandas"](https://github.com/mlpacks/aws-lambda-scikit-learn)  
  Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities.

[Tutorial: "AWS Lambda with XGBoost, Scikit-learn and Pandas"](https://github.com/mlpacks/aws-lambda-xgboost)   
XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
