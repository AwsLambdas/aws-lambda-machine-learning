# AWS Lambdas for Machine Learning

[AWSLambdaLayers.com](https://www.awslambdalayers.com/) develop AWS Lambdas and layers for Machine Learning.

* Save time and avoid the pain. The process of building, optimizing, and maintaining a Lambda layer is hard and painful, especially for Machine Learning with Python. It could take between a few days and a couple of weeks for a well-experienced geek.

* Benefit from our experience. Our layers have been optimized over the years and extensively tested through thousands of deployments.

* Small size. When it comes to a Lambda layer, every bit counts. Our layers are very small what allows more space for your application.

* Keep up with the latest versions. We release new layers with the latest versions regularly.

# Ready-to-use AWS Lambda demos

## AWS Lambda with Numpy and SciPy
NumPy and SciPy are popular scientific python libraries extensively used for Machine learning.

Check our tutorial [AWS Lambda with Numpy](https://github.com/AwsLambdaLayers/aws-lambda-numpy)

## AWS Lambda with Pandas
Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use data analysis and manipulation tool, that together with NumPy and SciPy are extensively used for Machine learning.

Check our tutorial [AWS Lambda with Pandas](https://github.com/AwsLambdaLayers/aws-lambda-pandas)

## AWS Lambda with Scikit-Learn and Pandas
Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning. It also provides various tools for model fitting, data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, and many other utilities.

Check our tutorial [AWS Lambda with Scikit-learn](https://github.com/AwsLambdaLayers/aws-lambda-scikit-learn)

## AWS Lambda with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost and Pandas
XGBoost is an optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
